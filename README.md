This is one of my personal projects where we will be predicting the wine variety column using different features such as

  1. User Reviews
  2. Ratings Score
  3. Country
  4. Provinces

 > !pip install "module name"
 
 This project can be broken into two parts
 
  1. [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/cyber-noob/Wine-Variety-Prediction/blob/master/wine_eda.ipynb)
  2. [Predictive modelling](https://github.com/cyber-noob/Wine-Variety-Prediction/blob/master/wine1.ipynb)
