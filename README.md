# Wine Variety Prediction

This is one of my personal projects where we will be predicting the wine variety column using different features such as

  1. User Reviews
  2. Ratings Score
  3. Country
  4. Provinces

Here I shall be using **Google Colab** using its inbuilt modules. If some modules are out of scope for google colab we can easily install it using the command:

 > !pip install "module name"
 
 This project can be broken into two parts
 
  1. [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/cyber-noob/Wine-Variety-Prediction/blob/master/wine_eda.ipynb)
  2. [Predictive modelling](https://github.com/cyber-noob/Wine-Variety-Prediction/blob/master/wine1.ipynb)
